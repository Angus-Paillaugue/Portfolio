A website replica of Nude Project (clothing brand), built with SvelteKit. This project is a faithful reproduction of an online shop that I found on the internet.


## Key Features
 - **Stock Management** : The system allows for stock management, enabling you to add or remove products.
 - **Cart and Payment** : Users can add products to their cart and proceed with payment (note: this is not real).
 - **Email Confirmation** : A confirmation email is sent to users after they have placed an order (again, this is ).


## Advanced Features
 - **MongoDB Integration** : The project uses MongoDB as a database to store product and order information.
 - **TailwindCSS Integration** : The website utilizes TailwindCSS for optimized design and ergonomics.


## Project Details

The Shop is a fictional online shop. While the features are realistic, it's actually a simulation without real money or physical shipping. This project was created to test and demonstrate my skills in building e-commerce websites with SvelteKit.
